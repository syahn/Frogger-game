# Frogger game
I made this with art assets and game engine provided by Udacity Front end nanodegree project.

## Play
-> [My version](https://syahn.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade_game/) <br>
-> [Original demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxeHV1kt7iU&feature=youtu.be)

## How to play
<ol>
    <li> Select the character </li>
    <li> Collect 3 gems by each color </li>
    <li> If you get to the liver, you'll get </li>
</ol>
* new gems with different color
* new life in the field

## What I added from the default game demo

* Create own game mode for collecting three gems with randomized color of gems.
* Every sound effect for background, movement, reset, collision, etc.
* First landing page with character selection feature.
